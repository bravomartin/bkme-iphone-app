#BKME iPhone App

#### An iPhone app for reporting messed up bikelanes to [BKME](http://www.bkme.org), working for making cities a better place for bikers.

This is the work in progress iPhone App for BKME. It is being written with the help of [Titanium] (http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/), a layer to write native apps in friendly javascript.

## About this version

This is the second attempt to the app, after a failed attempt in PhoneGap, which is fairly easy but very limiting.

The app is not in a functional state yet, but very close to it.

##TODO
* upload contents in a post request to the server.
    * handle errors and inform the user.
    * daemon/setTimeout to try to send periodically.
* Messaging system to show and delete temporary messages.
* probably more.


##Acknowledgements 

Done over a few Saturdays in collaboration with BKME partner [rbtkoz](https://github.com/rbtkoz). 

Thanks to [mpociot] (https://github.com/mpociot) for [Titanium Twitter oAuth] (https://github.com/mpociot/titanium-twitter-oauth) and to the whole titanium and stackoverflow community.
